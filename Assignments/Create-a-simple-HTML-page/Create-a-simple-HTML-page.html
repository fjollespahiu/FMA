    <p>I don't know what else to say so here's my favorite monologue from the Little Women movie I mentioned above.
    <blockquote> <i>
            It’s no use Jo. Jo, we’ve got to have
            it out..
            I have loved you ever since
            I have known you Jo -- I
            couldn’t help it, and I
            tried to show and you
            wouldn’t let me, which is fine,
            but I must make you hear now and
            give me an answer because I
            can’t go on like this any
            longer.
            I gave up billiards,
            I gave up everything you didn’t
            like, I'm happy I did,
            it's fine and I waited and I never
            complained. Because I...
            You know I figured you'd love me, Jo.
