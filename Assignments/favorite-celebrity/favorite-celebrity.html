            <p><a href="https://www.onedirectionmusic.com/gb/home.html">One Direction</a> was originally formed as a
                five-member band in X-Factor 2010. The five members, <a href="https://www.hstyles.co.uk/">Harry
                    Styles</a>, <a href="https://www.liampayneofficial.com/">Liam Payne</a>, <a
                    href="https://louis-tomlinson.com/">Louis Tomlinson</a>, <a href="https://www.niallhoran.com/">Niall
                    Horan</a>, and <a href="https://www.inzayn.com/">Zayn Malik</a>, first auditioned as solo
                candidates, before
                the judges decided to put them together in a band.

            The band got together for two weeks to get to know each other and rehearse. <i>Harry Styles</i> came up with
            the
            band's
            name. <br>
            The first performance of these boys together was this one, where they covered <i>Torn</i> by Natalie
            Imbruglia:

            <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p>One Direction were an immediate fan-favorite, but that did not get them the first place on X-factor, as they
            were eleminated in the finals.
            <br>Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported Â£2
            million
            Syco Records record contract.

                On 25 March 2015, amid the Asia leg of their tour, the band announced <i>Malik</i>'s departure with an
                official
                statement. <q>I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels
                    right
                    in my heart</q>, <i>Malik</i> said in the statement. <q>I am leaving because I want to be a normal
                    22-year-old who
                    is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for
                    life in
                    Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.</q>
